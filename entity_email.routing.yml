# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines what function
# or method will be called when a URL is accessed.
# If the user accesses http://mysite.com//spd/email/entity/{eid}, the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\entity_email\Controller\EmailEnitityController")
# and a method ("emailEntity").
